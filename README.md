This public repo demonstrates the scripting experience I have. I have included a simple script sample for each script I wrote. The repo includes multiple folders, with each folder containing Python scripts that do not contain any sensitive data (tokens, emails, passwords).

COURSERA folder includes script samples from Coursera assignments (self-learning course).

Route Academy is an instructor-led course with script assignments at the end of each session.

Alcis folder contains multiple script samples I used during my work, excluding any sensitive data.

QSIT contains a script for change detection from satellite imagery.
