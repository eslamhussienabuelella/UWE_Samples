This public repo demonstrates the scripting experience I have. I have included a simple script sample for each script I wrote. The repo includes multiple folders, with each folder containing Python scripts that do not contain any sensitive data (tokens, emails, passwords).

1. Alcis folder contains multiple script samples I used during my work, excluding any sensitive data.
2. COURSERA folder includes script samples from Coursera assignments (self-learning course).
3. QSIT contains a script for change detection from satellite imagery.
4. Route Academy is an instructor-led course with script assignments at the end of each session.
